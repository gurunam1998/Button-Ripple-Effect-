Button Ripple Effect using HTML, CSS and Javascript

# Introduction of Button-Ripple-Effect-
The Button Ripple Effect is a visually appealing UI interaction where a ripple-like animation spreads outward when a button is clicked. This effect enhances user experience by providing immediate feedback on interactions.
The ripple effect is commonly used in modern web design, especially in Material Design principles. It creates a dynamic wave effect when a user clicks on a button, making the interface feel more interactive.

How It Works
- HTML Structure – A simple button element is created.
- CSS Styling – The button is styled with animations and transitions.
- JavaScript Implementation – JavaScript detects the click position and generates a ripple effect dynamically.
